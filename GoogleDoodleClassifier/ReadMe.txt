The Google Doodle Challenge on Kaggle, where the dataset is doodles created by Users on the game, Quick Draw.
The challenge was: since the training data comes from the game itself, drawings can be incomplete or may not match the label. 
Targeted to build a recognizer that can effectively learn from the noisy data and perform well on a manually-labeled test 
set from a different distribution.
